	<h3> Hi! <br> <br> I'm Samuel. Gothenburg based <u>Software Engineer</u> & <u>Multi creator</u>.</h3>
	<p>Iâ€™ve worked as a Software Engineer for the past 3 years, delivering cutting edge technology for some of the biggest brands in Sweden. In my most recent projects my role has been focused around DevOps working mainly with Docker and Kubernetes in GCP and Azure.  
		<br><br>I also find Data Science facinating and have used Machine Learning techniques such as regression, classification, clustering and outlier detection in some of my projects, mainly in Python. I also love to explore and train my own creative style in whatever area that pequed my curiosity, be it webdesign, piano or lead climbing.
